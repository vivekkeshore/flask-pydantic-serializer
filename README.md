*Flask-Pydantic-Serializer* is a Python package that serializes the database objects using the pydantic models. 
This comes handy if you are pydantic along with Flask, Tornado, Pyramid or any other framework.

A single serialize call will take of validating the returned response as well as serializing it. There are options to include or exclude certain fields or exclude/include fields with null values.
